                        technology more than
                        anything else. At school I did well in physics and mathematics, understanding that I had good
                        logical thinking and I also didn't really like writing and writing long texts.</p>

                    <p> Once at university I had to work for a while to pay for my materials, because of this experience
                        I decided to start improving my skills that will help me in my career and I decided to go down
                        the path of web development, currently I am still learning many things both in development as in
                        other fields such as calculus or physics.</p>
